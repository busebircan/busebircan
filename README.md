- 👋 Hi, I’m @busebircan
- 👀 I’m interested in business analytics, process improvement and product management. Apart from geeky stuff I'm mostly into travelling to places where historical attractions
meet natural beauty.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, powerBI, SQL, Italian and solo jazz swing dance.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on using ML and other soft-computing techniques with python for predictive analyses and solving complex optimisation problems.
- 📫 How to reach me: let's connect on https://www.linkedin.com/in/buse-bircan-profil/.
